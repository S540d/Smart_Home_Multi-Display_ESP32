# Bug Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the critical bug fixes implemented to address the most important issues in the Smart Home Multi-Display ESP32 project.

## Fixed Issues

### Issue #2: Anti-Burn-In Shifts Display Out of Screen
**Priority**: Critical  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

**Problem**: The anti-burn-in system shifts display content by ¬±2 pixels, but coordinates near screen edges (320x240) would go outside display bounds, causing visual artifacts.

**Solution**: 
- Added `applyOffsetX()` and `applyOffsetY()` methods to `AntiBurninManager`
- Both methods use `constrain()` to ensure coordinates stay within display bounds
- Elements with width/height are constrained so their edges don't exceed display limits

**Code Changes**:
- `src/config.h`: Added bounds-checking methods to AntiBurninManager struct

**Impact**: Display content now safely shifts without drawing outside screen bounds.

### Issue #35: Touch Recognition Very Unreliable
**Priority**: Critical  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

**Problem**: Touch areas were defined with static coordinates but display content shifts with anti-burn-in, causing misalignment between touch areas and visible UI elements.

**Solution**:
- Updated `updateSensorTouchAreas()` to apply anti-burn-in offsets to touch coordinates
- Touch areas now follow display content as it shifts
- Main loop already calls `updateSensorTouchAreas()` when anti-burn-in changes

**Code Changes**:
- `src/touch.cpp`: Modified `updateSensorTouchAreas()` to get and apply offsets from `antiBurnin`

**Impact**: Touch detection now accurately matches shifted display content, especially in subpages.

### Issue #30: Watchdog Disabled, No System Recovery
**Priority**: Critical  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

**Problem**: Watchdog was disabled during setup (`esp_task_wdt_init(30, false)`), preventing automatic recovery from system hangs or infinite loops.

**Solution**:
- Enabled watchdog with panic mode: `esp_task_wdt_init(30, true)`
- Added current task to watchdog monitoring: `esp_task_wdt_add(NULL)`
- Added periodic watchdog feeding in main loop: `esp_task_wdt_reset()`

**Code Changes**:
- `src/main.cpp`: 
  - Line 120-121: Enable watchdog and add task
  - Line 164: Feed watchdog at start of each loop iteration

**Impact**: System will automatically restart if main loop hangs for >30 seconds, improving field reliability.

### Issue #32: NTP Starting Very Late
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

**Problem**: Time synchronization was slow due to long delays (500ms x 3 attempts = 1.5s blocking time) and insufficient retry attempts.

**Solution**:
- Reduced delay per attempt from 500ms to 200ms for faster initialization
- Increased retry attempts from 3 to 5 for better success rate
- Added detailed logging to track synchronization progress
- Improved error messages for debugging

**Code Changes**:
- `src/main.cpp`: Enhanced `initializeTime()` function with:
  - Faster retries (200ms vs 500ms)
  - More attempts (5 vs 3)
  - Better logging ("üïê Starte NTP-Zeitsynchronisation...")

**Impact**: Time synchronization is faster (max 1s vs 1.5s) and more reliable (66% more attempts).

### Issue #1: LDR Not Working, Very Unstable
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

**Problem**: ESP32 ADC readings on pin 34 are notoriously unstable when WiFi is active, causing flickering LDR values.

**Solution**:
- Implemented median filter instead of simple average (more robust against outliers)
- Increased sample count from 3 to 9 for better noise reduction
- Added ADC attenuation configuration (`ADC_11db` for 0-3.3V range)
- Added moving average filter (20% weight) to smooth WiFi interference
- Display now shows smoothed value instead of raw reading

**Code Changes**:
- `src/utils.cpp`: 
  - Rewrote `readADCFiltered()` with median filter and ADC configuration
  - Uses quicksort to find median value (robust against WiFi noise spikes)
- `src/main.cpp`:
  - Increased samples to 9
  - Added moving average: `calculateMovingAverage(rawLdr, smoothed, 0.2f)`
- `src/config.h`: Added `ldrValueSmoothed` field
- `src/display.cpp`: Display smoothed value instead of raw

**Impact**: LDR readings are now stable and reliable despite WiFi interference.

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Anti-Burn-In Test
- Let display run for 15+ minutes until anti-burn-in triggers
- Verify all UI elements stay within screen bounds
- Check corners and edges for clipping

### 2. Touch Test
- Wait for anti-burn-in shift to occur
- Test touch on all 8 sensor boxes in different shift states
- Verify touch works in subpages (price detail, charging view, etc.)

### 3. Watchdog Test
- Intentionally create a long blocking operation (e.g., infinite loop in debug)
- Verify system restarts automatically after 30 seconds
- Check serial output for watchdog reset message

### 4. NTP Test
- Monitor serial output during boot
- Verify "‚úÖ Zeit erfolgreich synchronisiert" message appears
- Check time display shows correct time within 1 second of boot

### 5. LDR Test
- Cover and uncover light sensor multiple times
- Verify displayed value changes smoothly without flickering
- Compare raw vs smoothed values in serial log

## Future Improvements

While these fixes address the critical issues, consider these enhancements:

1. **Issue #23**: RTOS task-based architecture for better responsiveness
2. **Issue #24**: Display dirty rectangle system for performance
3. **Issue #26**: Standardized error handling with Result<T> pattern
4. **Issue #27**: Replace global variables with state management
5. **Issue #28**: Dynamic power management for efficiency
